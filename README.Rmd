<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of roundR is to offer a numeric rounding to the nearest integer, as opposed to the [base::round()] default to round to the nearest *even* integer.

## Installation

You can install the development version of roundR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nkhusainy/roundR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(roundR)
## basic example code
round(2.5)
round_to_integer(2.5)
```
